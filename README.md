# ABC - Audio Book Cutter

This Project is for extracting Chapters from a single file audio book.
You have to extract the chapter duration somehow, for example parsing the WebPage of the Audio Book in Google Play Books.

# TODO

- Adding WebSite-Parser to extract the chapter timings from Google Play Books.

# Run Program
This program is written purely in python 3!
The PIP Libraries are not necessary, so you don't have to download them yet.
